# RCO3 Launcher
Simple program to run RCO3 using NodeJS.

## Why?

RCO3 needs an executable to run it, as I cannot easily create menu items cross-platform for `node <dir>/index.js`. This is a simple program that will run RCO3 using NodeJS.

## Why rust?

Go hates me.

### Why not node?

Too large exec size.
