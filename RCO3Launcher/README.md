# RCO3 Node Launcher

This is a simple Go Executable that runs `node <dir>/index.js` - if not found, it downloads it from [here](https://roblox-client-optimizer.simulhost.com/RCO-JS/index.js).<br/>
Yup. That's it.

## Why go?

Small output exe size + No runtime needed.

###### Note to self

Consider implementing something similar for the installer that downloads the actual binary without the icon res edit, and then runs it.
